                                                                Heart Disease Analysis Project:


This project focuses on analyzing factors associated with heart disease using a dataset from the Heart 2020 dataset. The dataset contains various features such as BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical and mental health metrics, sex, age category, presence of diabetes, physical activity levels, sleep time, asthma, kidney disease, and skin cancer.

##Dataset Overview:

The dataset consists of 10,017 samples and 15 features.
Features include both categorical and numerical variables.
Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, converting age categories to numeric values, removing duplicate entries, and dropping irrelevant features like BMI for analysis.

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explored the distribution of heart disease cases across different age categories and sexes.
Investigated the relationship between physical health and age category.
Examined the impact of physical activity on physical and mental health.
Visualized correlations between sleep time, mental health, and physical health.

##Key Findings

Heart disease appears to be more prevalent in older age categories, particularly around 80 years old.
Physical activity may play a role in improving physical and mental health, as observed in the scatterplot analysis.
There seems to be a correlation between sleep time and both mental and physical health, suggesting the importance of adequate sleep in maintaining overall well-being.

##Future Work

Conduct further analysis on specific risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and presence of diabetes.
Explore machine learning models to predict heart disease based on the available features.
Expand the dataset to include more diverse demographics and additional health-related features for a comprehensive analysis.
